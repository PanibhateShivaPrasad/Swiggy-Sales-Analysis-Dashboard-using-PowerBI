# Swiggy-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-using-PowerBI

Excited to share my Task 1 as a Data Science & Analytics Intern at Future Interns !

I built an interactive Business Sales Dashboard using Power BI, analyzing e-commerce (Swiggy-style) data to uncover:

 ✅ Best-selling dishes
 
 ✅ Sales trends (daily & monthly)
 
 ✅ High-revenue cities and categories
 
 ✅ Customer ratings & order behavior

This project strengthened my skills in:

 📊 Data cleaning & modeling
 
 📈 DAX measures
 
 📉 Trend analysis
 
 🧠 Business storytelling
 
 🎨 Dashboard design

Looking forward to learning more and building impactful data-driven solutions!
